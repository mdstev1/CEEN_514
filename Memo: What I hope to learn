I hope to learn more about coding, API's, and how to develop web apps.


Our Final Project is going to allow the user to calculate the least cost path for use in an evacuation scenario. 
We are going to include a video overview of the app, followed by step-by-step instructions.
The app itself will include several places to input shapefiles, but will also include the option to pick points on the map, if applicable.
